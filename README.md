# EGG Protocol

## Short Description

EGG Protocol multiplies yield by enabling assets escrowing on cross-chain smart contracts.

Cocoricos.io permits frictionless access to decentralized finance (DeFi). Data-driven due diligence filters proof of liquidity, soft stake and proof of stake (PoS) assets around a single interface.

This repository contains the EGG Token implementation and its set of smart contracts for a staking, voting and periodic token burns and a lockable token distribution.
